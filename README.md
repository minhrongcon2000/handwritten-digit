# Convolutional Neural Network in Handwritten Digit Recognition
## I. Introduction:
Convolutional Neural Network has become a powerful tool in image processing tasks. It is so powerful that nowadays, it is considered to be the first to think about when it comes to an image processing task. In this repository, I will show the effect of this model by using it in handwritten digit recognition to see the enourmous effects it provides.
